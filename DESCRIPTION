Description: EMGhelpeR is a user-friendly R package designed to simplify electromyography (EMG) analysis. Leveraging the 'signal' package for signal processing in R, EMGhelpeR offers a user-friendly interface for EMG analysis tasks. The package includes features for filtering EMG data, rectifying and integrating EMG signals, performing power spectral analyses, and extracting key features through peak detection. EMGhelpeR empowers researchers to conduct efficient EMG analyses within the R environment, offering a straightforward and accessible solution for both basic and advanced users.
